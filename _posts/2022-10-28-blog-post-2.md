1. What is learning?

2. From learning to machine learning

3. Key essence of machine learning

4. Components of machine learning

## Detail

### What is learning

learning: acquiring skill with experience accumulated from observations

### From learning to machine learning

machine learning: acquiring skill with experience accumulated/computed from data

**What is skill?**

improve some performance measure (e.g. prediction accuracy)

Therefore, machine learning is: improving some performance measure with experience computed from data.

### Key essence of machine learning

1. exists some 'underlying pattern' to be learned

2. but no programmable (easy) definition

3. somehow there is data about the pattern

key essence above help to decide whether to use machine learning

### Components of machine learning

what learning algorithm does is use data to compute g that **approximate** the **unknown** target function f by picking an function from the **hypothesis set** based on some **metric**.
